## Overview

DotIgnore is designed to work seamlessly with multiple version control systems. The tools provided allow you to convert existing ignore files to the `.DotIgnore` format, validate your files, and integrate them into your development workflow.

The integration process typically involves:

1. Converting existing ignore files (like `.gitignore` or `.svnignore`) to the `.DotIgnore` format
2. Validating the resulting files to ensure they comply with the standard
3. Setting up your VCS system to use the `.DotIgnore` files
4. Optionally integrating with CI/CD pipelines and other tools
